# Environment and Project setup

To start with the tutorial, you'll need a fresh Eclipse Oxygen with the latest Xtext 2.12 release installed.
Also at least Java 8 JDK is required to be installed on you machine.

## Creating the projects

Creating the set of projects (or modules) for your Xtext Language Server is very easy, as it is supported by the Eclipse Wizard.
From the main menu please choose _File -> New -> Project..._. In the opened dialog you need to select _Xtext Project_ and click _Next_.

Next up we need to give the project as well as our language a name. In addition the file extension for our language needs to be specified. IF you don't want to get out of sync with the tutorial, you should provide the following values:

![Wizard Page #1](img/wizard_01.png)

On the next page, you can configure your project. We don't want an Eclipse plug-in, nor native support for intellij or web, as we are going to implement the LSP. Also we want to use Gradle as the build system and the maven/gradle source layout.

## The projects

After clicking _Finish_ on the last wizard page, Eclipse will create three projects for you:

### org.xtext.calc

Here you will find the grammar and other core language constructs, that are needed for any kind of language usage. Some common examples of functionality you will find here are:

  - lexer, parser 
  - AST types
  - linker
  - validation
  - generator
  - interpreter

### org.xtext.calc.ide

This project contains tool specific features, that you don't usually need when using a language implementation at runtime, e.g. to execute and interpreter. But only if you use it to support an editor. Examples of functionality that should go here is:
  - content assist
  - hover
  - method signature helper

You don't necessarily need to split the two project, but could lump them together if you feel two projects are too much for this. But the wizard creates it like that by default.

### org.xtext.calc.parent

The parent project for the other two modules explained above.

## Define the grammar

The wozard should have opened the grammar file for you already. From the start it contains a tiny hello-world-example, that we now want to replace with our calculation DSL.

For this tutorial we don't want to go into too detail about how the Xtext grammar language works. If you want to learn more, please [check out the documentation](https://eclipse.org/Xtext/documentation/301_grammarlanguage.html).

```{xtext}
grammar org.xtext.calc.Calculator with org.eclipse.xtext.common.Terminals

generate webCalc "http://www.xtext.org/example/webcalc/WebCalc"

Calculation:
	statements+=Statement*;

Statement:
	Definition | Evaluation;

AbstractDefinition:
	Definition | DeclaredParameter;

Definition:
	native?='native' name=ID isFunction?='(' (params+=DeclaredParameter (',' params+=DeclaredParameter)*)? ')' |
	'let' name=ID (isFunction?='(' (params+=DeclaredParameter (',' params+=DeclaredParameter)*)? ')')? ':' expression=Expression;

DeclaredParameter:
	name=ID;

Evaluation:
	expression=Expression;

Expression:
	Addition;

Addition returns Expression:
	Multiplication ->({BinaryExpression.left=current} operator=('+' | '-') right=Multiplication)*;

Multiplication returns Expression:
	UnaryExpression ({BinaryExpression.left=current} operator=('*' | '/') right=UnaryExpression)*;

UnaryExpression returns Expression:
	({UnaryExpression} operator='-' expression=PrimaryExpression) |
	PrimaryExpression;

PrimaryExpression returns Expression:
	'(' Expression ')' |
	NumberLiteral |
	FeatureCall;
	
FeatureCall :
	feature=[AbstractDefinition] ->('(' (args+=Expression (',' args+=Expression)*)? ')')?;

NumberLiteral:
	value=Number;

Number:
	INT ('.' INT)?;
```

## Configure the Xtext generator

We also have changed the `mwe2` file a bit to fit our needs. Specifically we don't need a stub for the scope provider (we use the default scoping) and the generator (we will later implement an interpreter, instead).

Here are the relevant changes:

```
... 
        language = StandardLanguage {
			name = "org.xtext.calc.Calculator"
			fileExtensions = "calc"

			serializer = {
				generateStub = false
			}
			generator = {
				generateStub = false
			}
			scopeProvider = {
				generateStub = false
			}
			validator = {
				composedCheck = "org.eclipse.xtext.validation.NamesAreUniqueValidator"
			}
		}
...
```

## Generate the language infrastructure

Now we are all set to start the Xtext generator. To do so you can right click in either the `Calculator.xtext` or the `GenerateCalculator.mwe2` file and choose _Run As_->_Generate Xtext Artifacts_. Alternatively you can run the gradle build.

## Writing a first test

After code generation there might be a compile error in the generated test file `CalculatorParsingTest.xtend`. Let's replace the contents with the following to verify that we can at least parse our example without any errors:

```{xtend}
package org.xtext.calc.tests

import com.google.inject.Inject
import org.eclipse.xtext.testing.InjectWith
import org.eclipse.xtext.testing.XtextRunner
import org.eclipse.xtext.testing.util.ParseHelper
import org.junit.Assert
import org.junit.Test
import org.junit.runner.RunWith
import org.xtext.calc.webCalc.Calculation

@RunWith(XtextRunner)
@InjectWith(CalculatorInjectorProvider)
class CalculatorParsingTest {
	
	@Inject 	ParseHelper<Calculation> parseHelper
	
	@Test
	def void loadModel() {
		val result = parseHelper.parse('''
			/** Calculates the area of a square. */
			let square(a): pow(a, 2)
			
			/** Calculates the area of a cirecle based on the radius argument. */
			let circle(r): PI * pow(r, 2)
			
			/** Returns with the volume of a cube. */
			let cube(a): pow(a, 3) 
			
			/** Calculates the volume of a sphere. */
			let sphere(r): (4 / 3)  * PI * pow(r, 3)
			
			let a: 10
			let r: a / 2
			
			let aSquare: square(a)
			let aCircle: circle(r)
			
			/** Evaluate the value of the area difference by hitting Shift + Enter. */
			aSquare - aCircle
			
			cube(a) - sphere(r)
		''')
		Assert.assertNotNull(result)
		Assert.assertTrue(result.eResource.errors.isEmpty)
	}
}

```

## Packaging as a Language Server

A language server simply is a process that a tool can execute and communicate with over JSON-RPC. Most often the process' input and output streams are used to send over the messages, but once can also use a socket.

To start our language server we need to provide an executable. Xtext is running on the JVM, so we need to make it easy to start a Java process. I used the shadowJar gradle plugin to create a so called _uberJar_ for our application that contains all upstream dependencies. So we can run it by executing `java -jar calculator-language-server.jar`.

To apply the shadowJar plugin, we change the 'build.gradle' file in the parent project like this:

```
buildscript {
  …
  dependencies {
     classpath ‘com.github.jengelman.gradle.plugins:shadow:1.2.4'
     …

…
subprojects {
  …
  apply plugin: 'com.github.johnrengelman.shadow'
…
```

In addition we need to configure the shadowJar task in the *.ide project’s build.gradle:

```
shadowJar {
    baseName = 'calculator-language-server'
    classifier = null
    version = null
    manifest {
        attributes 'Main-Class': 'org.eclipse.xtext.ide.server.ServerLauncher'
    }
}
````

On the root level, you can now execute `.gradlew shadowJar`, which should do the build and produce a jar file that contains all upstream dependencies.

The specified main-class is shipped with Xtext and provides a standard way to start a language server that will run all languages that are on the classpath. In other words,with Xtext you can have one language server that can handle multiple Xtext languages. This is important if those languages link against each other. Also, editors usually communicate with a language server process through ‘standard in’ and ‘standard out’ which is the case here, too.

# LSP4E Integration

To use our language server within Eclipse, we can utilize the new LSP4E project, which is the generic LSP supporting infrastructure for Eclipse.

## Create a plain Eclipse plug-in project

The first thing we need to do is to create a plug-in project, with an Activator. The easiest way to that is to use the Eclipse project wizard.

## Register our language server

Since our language server is implemented in Java, we could run it in the main eclipse process. However, to be more inline with the general usage pattern of LSP4E we will start anither java process from within this plug-in.

Hooking up a language server is pretty easy, we only need to create a subclass of `ProscessStreamConnectionProvider` and tell it about the command to be executed to launch the LS process.

```{Java}

public class CalculatorLanguageServer extends ProcessStreamConnectionProvider {

	public CalculatorLanguageServer() {
		List<String> commands = new ArrayList<>();
		commands.add("java");
		commands.add("-jar");
		Bundle bundle = Activator.getDefault().getBundle();
		URL resource = bundle.getResource("/language-server/calculator-language-server.jar");
		try {
			commands.add(new File(FileLocator.resolve(resource).toURI()).getAbsolutePath());
		} catch (URISyntaxException | IOException e) {
			throw new IllegalStateException(e);
		}
		setCommands(commands);
		setWorkingDirectory(Platform.getLocation().toOSString());
	}

	@Override
	public String toString() {
		return "Calculator Language Server: " + super.toString();
	}
}

```

As you can see we reference a jarthat should be located in the plugin itself. We enhanced the original gradle script in `org.xtext.calc.ide` to copy over the jar after it gets created with the following:

```{Gradle}
task buildLSP(type: Copy) {
	from 'build/libs/calculator-language-server.jar'
	into '../../org.xtext.calc.lsp4e/language-server'
}

buildLSP.dependsOn shadowJar
```

## Adding a TextMate Grammar

Since lexical syntax coloring is not provided by the language server protocol, we need to provide it manually. Therefore we have added a syntax defintion file, using the TextMate grammar language.

Have a look [here](org.xtext.calc.lsp4e/syntaxes/calc.tmLanguage.json)
